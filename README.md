Ultimate Noughts and Crosses
==============================

This version of ultimate tic tac toe is my project for learning AngularJS, and p.
When playable it will be available on my profile website (under construction).
This project is also meant to practice AI development, which when completed will be added to the site.
All code will be original.

Ultimate Noughts and Crosses is a large board that is determined by the smaller boards within.
A move within a board indicates the board on which the next player must make their mark. 
My version will allow for the choice between the two variations:
    1. A player must fill in a box if there is an open space despite the board being won.
    2. A player has free choice if made to go to a board that has been won.
